# UnsupervisedLearningMiniProject01_KmeanClustering_TeamPlayerCategorization
Read the following cricket dataset : https://taxila-aws.bits-pilani.ac.in/pluginfile.php/1390403/mod_assign/intro/cricketers.csv

a) Identify the all-rounder by the following logic -> Get the players with most runs whose wickets are more than the median wickets of all the players where the players must have taken atleast 1 wicket. [ 3 Marks ]

b)  Perform K-means clustering for different values of K (2,3,4,5) and evaluate the quality of clustering using the Silhouette score. [3 points]

c) For each value of K, plot clusters (all cluster points in the same cluster with the same color, cluster points in different clusters in different colors).  Use PCA for dimensionality reduction so that the data points can be plotted in 2 - D. Take only 5 data points from each cluster and the point should be labelled with the player name, else 0 marks.  [3 pt] 

d) Draw a bar graph with X-axis as K value and Y-axis as silhouette score. [1.5 pt]

e) List down 10  players with each cluster and categorize them to the batsman, all-rounder, bowler, etc. [1.5 pt]
